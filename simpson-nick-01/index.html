            <h3>Have you already created a website?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Since Web 115 I started freelancing websites. It has been more of a hustle than a business but its good experience. My first website was built because someone heard that I can build websites. It wasn't much but the client was happy.</p>

            <h3>How did you do in WEB-115 and WEB-210?</h3>
            <p>I managed to get an A in both WEB-115 and WEB-210. I really enjoyed these classes and I hope WEB-215 is the same.</p>

            <h3>Are you confident in your coding skills?</h3>
            <p>I am very confident in my HTML and CSS. PHP has been a little bit of a challenge but I have been doing well in the classes. I have also been learning other frameworks like SCSS.</p>

            <h3>Can you write semantic and valid code. How do you know?</h3>
            <p>I do believe that I write good semantic code and it is valid. The reason I know it is valid because I use W3Schools validation tools to check. As for the semantic, the rules change constantly but I will use a few tools to make sure everything is semantically correct.<a href="https://caniuse.com/">Can I Use</a> <a href="https://seositecheckup.com/">SEO Site Checkup</a></p>
